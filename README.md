# tskit
The tree sequence toolkit

**This repository is a placeholder, and currently only exists to ensure the 
  name isn't taken on PyPI.**

Currently, the `tskit` tools are still bundled with the Python package [`msprime`](https://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime).
We expect to separate the two soon,
but to use `tskit` in the meantime, [install `msprime`](https://msprime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html),
and then
```
import msprime as tskit
```
will get you the functionality that `tskit` will provide in the future.
