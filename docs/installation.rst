Installation
============

.. note:: This documentation is incomplete. Once we have a conda package that
    is installable we'll update the documentation to use that route also. However,
    as there are no external dependencies, pip should work well for all
    non-Windows users.

Please install ``tskit`` from PyPI using pip::

    $ python -m pip install tskit
